## The motivation:
 
With the rapid change in climate and increasing global warming , quick response to a disaster saves a lot of lives. According to a report, climate change-induced natural disasters killed almost 3,000 people and 70,000 livestock, and destroyed around 4.1 lakh houses just this year alone. They also affected 18 lakh hectares of crop area â€” about 1% of the total cropped area in India . We studied that results can be a little worse off if we plan and manage effectively during a crisis.

The motivation for the Astrum project stems from the realization that current post-disaster management systems are often fragmented and inefficient. In the aftermath of a disaster, the ability to quickly and effectively collect, analyze, and disseminate critical information is essential for the safety and well-being of affected communities. However, the lack of a centralized platform for data management and communication can lead to confusion, duplication of efforts, and wasted resources.

Astrum aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive and customizable platform for post-disaster management. The platform includes a web-based interface for data input and visualization, as well as a set of tools for data analysis and decision-making. It also includes a **mobile application [(PWA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)** that allows users to report incidents and request assistance in real-time.

The Astrum project is driven by the belief that by making post-disaster management more efficient and effective, we can better serve the needs of affected communities and aid organizations. We hope that by providing this open-source platform, we can help save lives and improve recovery efforts in the aftermath of disasters.

## How it works :

We have a built Disaster Risk Management System for better management and collaboration during a natural or man-made disaster .Our web helps in prediction of upcoming natural threats using Nasa API, along with that we have integrated platform for collaboration between Ngos , Police and Local helpers for faster evacuation and relief work.

  - The Astrum project includes a "Personalized Dashboard" feature, which allows users to view updated statistics, help requests, emergency requests, donation             information, and create broadcast messages all in one place. This feature can be accessed through the web-based interface and is designed to be user-friendly and       easy to navigate.
  - Here we also includes an "Alert Room" feature, which is a centralized platform for broadcasting important information, alerts, and relief updates to NGOs and           government authorities. This feature allows for real-time communication and coordination during a disaster event.
  - a live chat feature, which enables real-time communication between suffering people and authorities during a disaster event. This feature allows people to report       incidents and request assistance in real-time with privacy control, and allows authorities to respond quickly and efficiently.
  - Finding the hospots is difficult so , we also help authorities to identify the hotspots and type of help needed there for faster rescue /operation.
  - The Emergency Help feature is an important component of the Astrum project, as it allows people to quickly and easily request assistance in emergency situations,       and enables authorities to respond quickly and effectively to the needs of affected communities during a disaster event.
  - We used Nasa API we can track the upcoming volcanoes /tropical storms. (we expand this feature to other natural calamities)

## Live / One-to-One Chat (Astra-Chat)
The live chat feature can be accessed through a mobile application, and is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. It allows people to report incidents such as injuries, damage to property, and the need for evacuation. The authorities can use the chat feature to provide information on evacuation routes, emergency shelter locations, and other important information.

The live chat feature also allows authorities to request information from people on the ground. This can be used to gather information on the extent of damage, the number of people affected, and the resources needed for relief efforts.

<!---IDEAS--->
## Upcoming Ideas/ Improvements

We have loads of Ideas for our web app , for the time being we have thought of a few!

* Filtering about important tweets/ SOS during a calamity so that a need for help through social media doesnot go unnoticed! 
* **Multi-language support:** The project can be translated and customized to support multiple languages to reach a wider audience and to better serve the needs of       people speaking different languages.
* **Virtual and augmented reality:** The project can use virtual and augmented reality to provide users with more immersive and detailed information about disasters.     This can include 3D maps, simulations of disasters, and virtual tours of affected areas.
* We gonna implement AI and machine learning to analyze the data collected and make predictions about the spread and severity of disasters. This can help authorities     and NGOs to respond more effectively and efficiently.
